# SwiftTree
A quick exercise in Swift. Simple Binary Search Tree implementation in Swift. 

## Details
Perhaps one of the best ways to learn a new language is to play around with data structure implementations. For quite some time I've been meaning to explore the exciting world of Swift, and this weekend I managed to put aside a few hours and get my hands dirty.

This is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (with insertion, traversal, retrieval and deletion) in Swift. 

I'm hoping to come back and improve this implementation. Perhaps use generic as opposed to Ints.
